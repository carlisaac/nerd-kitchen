# Tuna & Egg Salad

**Serves:** 1

## Ingredients:

* 2-3 Hard Boiled Eggs
* 1 Can of tuna (Any kind works)
* Avocado (Needs to be ripe!)
* 1/4 cup chopped Chives
* Yellow Mustard to Taste.

## Directions:

1. Take your eggs and chop them up with a fork.
1. Drain the water out of your can of tuna and put the tuna in with the eggs.
1. Mix!
1. Add the avocado.  The avocado is going to substitute for your traditional mayo in this recipe.
1. Add chives and yellow mustard to taste.
1. Mix!

**NOTE:** We are using avocado instead of mayo in this recipe.  You can use mayo if you want, but make sure it’s real mayo (not miracle whip) or a “salad dressing”.  Check the ingredients to make sure it’s eggs and oil, and not chemicals!
