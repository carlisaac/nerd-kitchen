# Honey Salmon

**Serves:** 1

## Ingredients:

* Piece of Salmon
* 1/2 c. Raw Honey
* 1/4 c. Balsamic Vinegar

## Directions:
1. Preheat oven to 425°F / 220°C.
1. Heat the honey for about 15-20 seconds in the microwave to melt it a bit.
1. Mix the vinegar and the honey
1. Cut a few sliced angles into the top for the honey/vinegar to sink in.
1. Brush the honey/balsamic combination on top of the salmon.
1. Bake the salmon for 12-15 minutes.  You’ll know it’s done when you cut into it with a fork, and the middle is flaky and 
opaque.  You may see some white coming out of the fish, that’s normal – it’s just the fat. (The fish will continue 
to cook for 5 minutes *after* it’s left the oven, so keep that in mind.)
