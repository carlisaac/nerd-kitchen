# Creamy Red Curry Lentils

**Serves:** 5

**Serving Size:** ~1 1/2 cups

## Ingredients:





* 1 tablespoon avocado oil (or coconut oil)
* 1 cup onion, chopped
* 1 tablespoon garlic, minced
* 2 medium raw carrots, chopped into 1-inch pieces
* 5 tablespoons red curry paste
* 2 cups red lentils
* 1/2 can (14.5oz) diced tomatoes
* 1 can (13.5) lite coconut milk
* 2 cups (16oz) veggie broth
* Garnish
  * cilantro
  * lime

## Directions:

1. Set Instant Pot (or multi-function slow cooker) to “Saute.”  Add oil, onion, garlic and carrots.  
Cook for about 6 to 8 minutes until the onions are caramelized (brown) and the edges of the carrots are seared.
1. Add the red curry paste and the lentils, and mix everything together for 1 to 3 minutes, ensuring that each 
lentil is our covered in paste and oil.  Turn the Saute function off.
1. Add the remaining ingredients and stir.  Place on the top and set the Instant Pot on the “Pressure Cook” setting.  
Allow it to heat up first, then cook for 6 to 8 minutes for creamy lentils with a little bit of texture; or, 
8 to 10 minutes for creamy, smooth lentils with every individual lentil texture.  Season to taste with a bit of 
sea salt & pepper, then garnish with fresh cilantro and lime.
